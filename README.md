# StreetMarket
Street Market is a great way for individuals to connect with their local community and find unique products that they may not be able to find elsewhere. It's also a great way for local businesses to showcase their products and reach a wider audience. Whether you're looking to buy or sell, Street Market is the perfect app to help you connect with your local community and discover new products.

This app will be built with Flutter and Firebase and it will serve as my final project for my CSCC106 subject.
