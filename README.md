# StreetMarket
Street Market is a mobile application built for Koronadal City to help its citizens expose their products to their community. The app's primary objective is to uplift and amplify local businesses, ensuring they receive the recognition they deserve within their immediate vicinity.

This app was built with Flutter and Firebase and served as my final project for my CSCC106 subject.
